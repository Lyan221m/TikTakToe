### Session 2 - Fixed Cell Movement & Size Issues (2025-10-15)

#### Changes Made:
1. **styles.css** - Fixed game cells from moving during interactions
   - Removed `transform: translateY(-5px)` from `.cell:hover` (line 164-167)
   - Removed `transform: scale(1.05)` from `.cell.winner` animation (line 199-206)
   - Removed `transform: translateY(-3px)` from `.btn:hover` (line 254-260)
   - Changed `.btn:active` to use `opacity: 0.9` instead of transform
   - Removed `transform: scale()` from `.popIn` animation (line 181-188)

2. **styles.css** - Fixed row size changes when placing X or O
   - Added explicit `grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr)` to `.game-board`
   - Added `width: 100%` to `.game-board`
   - Added fixed sizing to `.cell`: `width: 100%`, `height: 100%`
   - Added `line-height: 1` to prevent text from affecting cell height
   - Added `min-width: 0` and `min-height: 0` to prevent grid items from expanding
   - **Result**: Grid cells maintain exact fixed size, preventing row/column shifts
