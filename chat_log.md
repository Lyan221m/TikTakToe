## Session 2 Update (2025-10-15)

### User Feedback
User reported that the game fields were moving during gameplay.

### Issue Identified
The CSS had transform properties that caused cells and buttons to move on hover and during interactions:
- Cells moved up on hover (`translateY(-5px)`)
- Winning cells scaled up (`scale(1.05)`)
- Buttons moved up on hover (`translateY(-3px)`)

### Solution Implemented
Modified `styles.css` to remove all transform-based movements:
1. Removed `transform: translateY(-5px)` from `.cell:hover` (line 164-167)
2. Removed `transform: scale(1.05)` from `.cell.winner` animation (line 199-206)
3. Removed `transform: translateY(-3px)` from `.btn:hover` (line 254-260)
4. Changed `.btn:active` to use `opacity: 0.9` instead of transform

### Additional Fix - Field Size Change Issue
User reported that when placing X or O, the field size was changing.

**Problem:** The `popIn` animation was using `transform: scale()` which changed from 0 → 1.2 → 1, causing the cell to grow during the animation.

**Solution:** Modified the `@keyframes popIn` animation (line 181-188) to only use opacity fade-in, removing all scale transforms.

### Additional Fix - Row Size Changes
User reported that the entire row size was changing when placing X or O.

**Problem:** The grid cells were not constrained to fixed sizes, allowing content to affect the grid layout. Text content was causing rows/columns to expand.

**Solution:** Modified `.game-board` and `.cell` styles (line 125-153):
- Added explicit `grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr)` to define fixed row heights
- Added `width: 100%` to `.game-board` for consistent sizing
- Added `width: 100%` and `height: 100%` to `.cell` to fill grid areas
- Added `line-height: 1` to prevent text line-height from affecting cell dimensions
- Added `min-width: 0` and `min-height: 0` to prevent grid items from auto-expanding

### Result
- Game cells now remain perfectly fixed in their grid positions
- No layout shifts during hover or interactions
- No size changes when placing X or O
- Entire grid rows and columns maintain fixed sizes
- Text content cannot affect cell or grid dimensions
- Visual feedback maintained through shadows and opacity changes
- Improved user experience with completely stable gameplay
